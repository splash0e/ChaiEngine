ChaiEngine is a compact, battery-powered DIY mixer designed for stirring milk, tea, coffee, or small liquids.
 Built using a recycled DC motor, a hand-wound copper coil for noise filtering, and a Tic Tac box as the battery casing, 
this micro-sized project demonstrates how everyday components can be transformed into a practical tool. With Type-C charging support 
 and a minimal footprint, ChaiEngine blends creativity, electronics, and real-world utility in one pocket-sized 
invention.
